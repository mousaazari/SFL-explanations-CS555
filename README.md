# Image Classification Explanation with LIME and SFL
## CS555 Computer Vision course project at Bilkent University
This project aims to enhance the interpretability of image classification models by leveraging the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique and Statistical Fault Localization (SFL) methods. By providing clear and understandable explanations for the predictions made by image classification models, we aim to increase transparency and trust in AI applications.
### Features
LIME Explanations: Utilize LIME to generate interpretable models that can explain the predictions of any classifier in an understandable manner.

SFL for Debugging: Apply SFL techniques to identify and diagnose errors in the image classification process, enabling more efficient debugging and improvement of model accuracy.

Model Agnostic: Works with any image classification model, providing flexibility and ease of integration into existing workflows.
